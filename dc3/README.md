Yammer is a social network for communicating with coworkers. Individuals share documents,
updates, and ideas by posting them in groups. Yammer is free to use indefinitely, but
companies must pay license fees if they want access to administrative controls, including
integration with user management systems like ActiveDirectory. You sit in their centralized
Analytics team, which sits in the Engineering organization.

You show up to work Tuesday morning, September 2, 2014. The head of the Product team
walks over to your desk and asks you what you think about the latest activity on the user
engagement dashboards.

## The Problem
What caused the drop in user engagement? Based on what you observe in the data, what
recommendations would you make to the organization?
